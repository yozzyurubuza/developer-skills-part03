//Lecture how to think like a developer

1. Make sure you 100% understand the problem - ask the right questions.

2. Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems.

3. Don't be afraid to do as much research as you have to.

4. Write pseudo-code before writing the actual code (not computer code)
